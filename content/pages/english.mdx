# Welcome to Queer Hangout in Drammen!  
  
## About us  
**Queer Hangout** is a meetingplace for gay, lesbian, trans, questioning/experimenting and other queer people in Drammen. We are a volunteer organization that meets once a month.

Queer Hangout is not only a friendgroup, but also a group of activists that work against loneliness in the queer community. Many feel they don't belong in the queer community, maybe because they're in a wheelchair and the venue has no ramps, or because you belong to a exposed minority like muslims or sex workers. We try to make everyone feel welcome, and work with every member and relevant organizations (Like <a href="skeivverden.no" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Skeiv Verden</a>) to achieve this.

## Rules  
![The safe and inclusive space guidelines, made by Skeiv Verden. One, inclusion, everyone should be included, seen and weelcome. Two, pronouns, respect the pronoun people use. Ask if you don't know. Three, tone of communication, use respectful language, avoid jokes which can easily be misunderstood. Four, touching, ask before making physical contact. People have different needs for personal space. Five, flirting, be mindful of not crossing other people's boundaries, flirting can make some people uncomfortable. Six, privacy, everyone has a different story and can decide what they want to share about themselves. It's okay to say no. Seven, confidentiality, respect anonymity. Do not share personal information of others. Eight, cameras, photos should always be taken with consent. Nine, open mind, misunderstandings happen, take care of each other. Relax, everyone makes mistakes! Accept and or give feedback in a constructive way. And be kind, always!](../images/safespage.jpg "Used with permission by Skeiv Verden")
  
  
1. Be nice to people. Queer Hangout includes exposed minorities like muslims, sex workers, disabled people, trans people, etc. As long as you're willing to learn and be respectful, you will be fine. Bigotry will not be accepted.  
2. Only queer people can go to our events. This includes if you are unsure or exploring identities. It is 100% okay to bring an assistant or a non-queer friend for support.  
3. Ask before you contact someone outside of Queer Hangouts. Not everyone is out of the closet! Don't give out other peoples contact information without permission, even to someone else in the group.
