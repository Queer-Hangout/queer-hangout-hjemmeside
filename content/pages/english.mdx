#Welcome to Queer Hangout  
  
**Queer Hangout** is a meetingplace for gay, lesbian, trans or otherwize queer adults in Drammen. We are a volunteer organisation that meets 2 times a month. We also have a seperate facebook-group where people can create their own activities, like birthdays, christmas workshop, forestwalks or breakfast at the 17th of may.  
  
Queer Hangout is not just a friendgroup, but also a group of activists who helps with loneliness in the queer community. Therefore, we work hard for inclusion and accesibility, especially for groups who usually doesn't feel welcome in the queer community, like disabled people, sex workers, muslims, etc.  
  
Come as you are!
